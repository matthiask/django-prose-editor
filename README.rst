About rich text editors
=======================

Copied from the `django-content-editor documentation <https://django-content-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

We have been struggling with rich text editors for a long time. To be honest, I do not think it was a good idea to add that many features to the rich text editor. Resizing images uploaded into a rich text editor is a real pain, and what if you’d like to reuse these images or display them using a lightbox script or something similar? You have to resort to writing loads of JavaScript code which will only work on one browser. You cannot really filter the HTML code generated by the user to kick out ugly HTML code generated by copy-pasting from word. The user will upload 10mb JPEGs and resize them to 50x50 pixels in the rich text editor.

All of this convinced me that offering the user a rich text editor with too much capabilities is a really bad idea. The rich text editor in FeinCMS only has bold, italic, bullets, link and headlines activated (and the HTML code button, because that’s sort of inevitable – sometimes the rich text editor messes up and you cannot fix it other than going directly into the HTML code. Plus, if someone really knows what they are doing, I’d still like to give them the power to shot their own foot).

If this does not seem convincing you can always add your own rich text plugin with a different configuration (or just override the rich text editor initialization template in your own project). We do not want to force our world view on you, it’s just that we think that in this case, more choice has the bigger potential to hurt than to help.


Installation
============

The first step is to ensure that you have an activated virtualenv for your
current project, using something like ``. .venv/bin/activate``.

Install the package into your environment:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install django-prose-editor

To include nh3 as optional dependency for sanitized HTML, install the extra
"sanitize":

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install django-prose-editor[sanitize]

Add ``django_prose_editor`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "django_prose_editor",
    ]

Replace ``models.TextField`` with ``ProseEditorField`` where appropriate:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_prose_editor.fields import ProseEditorField

    class Project(models.Model):
        description = ProseEditorField()

Note! No migrations will be generated when switching from and to
``models.TextField``. That's by design. Those migrations are mostly annoying.


Security
========

ProseMirror does a really good job of only allowing content which confirms to a
particular scheme. Of course users can submit what they want, they are not
constrainted by the HTML widgets you're using. You should still always sanitize
the HTML submitted on the server side. A good way to do this is by using the
``sanitize`` argument to the ``ProseEditorField``. You can use the following
snippet to always pass HTML through `nh3
<https://nh3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_prose_editor.sanitized import SanitizedProseEditorField

    description = SanitizedProseEditorField()

Install django-prose-editor with the extra "sanitize" to use
``SanitizedProseEditorField``.

Convenience
===========

Sometimes it may be useful to show an excerpt of the HTML field; the
``ProseEditorField`` automatically adds a ``get_*_excerpt`` method to models
which returns the truncated and stripped beginning of your HTML field's
content. The name would be ``Project.get_description_excerpt`` in the example
above.


Customization
=============

**NOTE!** The previous way of customizing the editor is still supported, but
it's not recommended (and documented) anymore.

The editor can be customized using presets; the way to do this is by adding a list of presets to your Django settings:

.. code-block:: python

    DJANGO_PROSE_EDITOR_PRESETS = {
        "announcements": {
            "script": "prose-editors/announcements.js",
        },
    }

The preset can be selected when instantiating the field:

.. code-block:: python

    text = ProseEditorField(_("text"), preset="announcements")

The announcements file is expected to initialize the editor by using the
``DjangoProseEditor`` library which is available on the browser ``window``
global. The example looks a bit involved, and it is -- but, this unlocks the
capability to add project-specific extensions without having to rebuild the
editor foundations:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // "announcements" is the name of the preset.
    const marker = "data-django-prose-editor-announcements"

    function createEditor(textarea) {
      if (textarea.closest(".prose-editor")) return
      const config = JSON.parse(textarea.getAttribute(marker))

      const {
        // Always recommended:
        Document, Dropcursor, Gapcursor, Paragraph, HardBreak, Text,

        // Add support for a few marks:
        Bold, Italic, Subscript, Superscript, Link,

        // A menu is always nice:
        Menu,

        // Helper which knows how to attach a prose editor to a textarea,
        // either textareas which exist already on page load and also those
        // added through the Django admin's inlines mechanism:
        createTextareaEditor,
      } = window.DjangoProseEditor

      const extensions = [
        Document, Dropcursor, Gapcursor, Paragraph, HardBreak, Text,

        Bold, Italic, Subscript, Superscript, Link.configure({ openOnClick: false }),

        Menu.configure({ config }),
      ]

      return createTextareaEditor(textarea, extensions)
    }

    window.DjangoProseEditor.initializeEditors(createEditor, `[${marker}]`)


Usage outside the Django admin
==============================

The prose editor can easily be used outside the Django admin. The form field
respectively the widget includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_prose_editor.fields import ProseEditorFormField

    class Form(forms.Form):
        text = ProseEditorFormField()

Or maybe you want to use ``django_prose_editor.widgets.ProseEditorWidget``, but
why make it more complicated than necessary.

If you're rendering the form in a template you have to include the form media:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <form method="post">
      {{ form.errors }} {# Always makes sense #}
      {{ form.media }}  {# This is the important line! #}
      {{ form.as_div }}
      <button type="submit">send</button>
    </form>

Note that the form media isn't django-prose-editor specific, that's a Django
feature.

The django-prose-editor CSS uses the following CSS custom properties.

* ``--prose-editor-background``
* ``--prose-editor-foreground``
* ``--prose-editor-border-color``
* ``--prose-editor-active-color``
* ``--prose-editor-disabled-color``

If you do not set them, they get their value from the following properties that
are defined in the Django admin's CSS:

* ``--border-color``
* ``--body-fg``
* ``--body-bg``
* ``--primary``

You should set these properties with appropriate values to use
django-prose-editor outside the admin in your site.

In addition, you may optionally set a ``--prose-editor-typographic`` property
to control the color of typographic characters when shown.
